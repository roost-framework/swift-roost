# Roost documentation

Roost uses Swift DocC, like ESW: authored guides sit beside API pages generated
from the public Swift declarations and their documentation comments. The
combined **Roost Libraries** navigator includes both libraries.

- [Roost](../Sources/Roost/Roost.docc/Roost.md): getting started, routes,
  middleware, typed views, forms, authentication, data, migrations, generators,
  configuration, deployment, and current implementation boundaries.
- [RoostTest](../Sources/RoostTest/RoostTest.docc/RoostTest.md): HTTP assertions,
  browser sessions, CSRF-protected workflows, and database test isolation.

These catalogs document Roost 2.0.0, with published ESW 1.5.0,
Spectro 2.1.0, and Nexus 2.0.0 dependencies.

## Build

Use Python 3 and a Swift toolchain containing DocC with `convert` and `merge`
support. The local build has been verified with Xcode 27.2 beta 2 (Swift 6.4).
From the framework root:

```sh
unset ROOST_ECOSYSTEM_PATH ROOST_ESW_PATH
python3 scripts/build_docs.py
```

The script builds the libraries and test modules, extracts their public symbol
graphs (including Roost's extensions to Nexus connections), checks both catalogs,
then merges them. **It compiles tests but does not run them or connect to a
database.** DocC conversion uses `--analyze --warnings-as-errors`; a failed build
keeps any previously generated archive intact.

The archive and SwiftPM build cache live outside the checkout by default:

```text
macOS:  ~/Library/Caches/roost-documentation/<checkout-id>/
Linux:  $XDG_CACHE_HOME/roost-documentation/<checkout-id>/
        (or ~/.cache/roost-documentation/<checkout-id>/)
```

The script prints the exact archive path and a local preview command. This
keeps generated files out of source control and avoids signed SwiftPM resource
bundles inside a synced source directory.

SwiftPM's native build backend is selected explicitly because the Xcode 27
Swift Build backend attempts to extract unrelated dependency C headers during
symbol graph generation. The preliminary test build provides the synthetic
test-runner module requested by SwiftPM 6.4. These are toolchain workarounds,
not additional application requirements.

## Browse locally

Run the printed `python3 -m http.server` command, or choose your own archive
location and port:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_docs.py --output /tmp/Roost.doccarchive
python3 -m http.server 61415 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /tmp/Roost.doccarchive
```

Open [Roost Libraries](http://127.0.0.1:61415/documentation/) or go directly to
[Getting started](http://127.0.0.1:61415/documentation/roost/gettingstarted/).
Use the sidebar filter to find guides and declarations. API links lead to the
current declaration, parameters, and related symbols.

The `.docc` catalogs are also available to Xcode's **Build Documentation**
command. The script is the reproducible path for the merged, two-library site.

## Prepare a GitHub Pages artifact

Build for the URL prefix where the archive will be served:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_docs.py \
  --hosting-base-path /swift-roost/docs \
  --output /tmp/Roost-Pages.doccarchive
```

Copy the **contents** of that archive into `docs/` in the GitHub Pages artifact,
beside the existing site's files. The entry point will then be
`/swift-roost/docs/documentation/`; deep links and assets use that same prefix.
This command prepares files only. It does not publish a site or change the
repository's deployment settings.

An archive built for `/` is for a server root. Rebuild with the hosting prefix
before placing it under a project site's subdirectory.

## Maintain the guides

Edit articles in `Sources/Roost/Roost.docc/` or
`Sources/RoostTest/RoostTest.docc/`, and API comments beside the Swift declarations.
Add new guides to their module landing page's `Topics` section so they appear
in the navigator. Rebuild after changing symbol links or signatures.

Keep examples aligned with the generators and actual request lifecycle. State
when an example needs PostgreSQL, a generated model, a session store, or a local
dependency override. Use the [acceptance record](../guides/dx-acceptance.md) for
framework verification; a successful documentation build validates neither
database workflows nor network transports.
